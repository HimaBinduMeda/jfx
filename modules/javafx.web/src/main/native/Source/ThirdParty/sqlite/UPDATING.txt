Updating SQLite in OpenJFX:

1. Find the current version of the SQLite used in JavaFX from VERSION.txt

2. Check if there are any JavaFX specific changes in SQLite source:
    - Compare the SQLite source files from JavaFX workspace with the source files
      corresponding to same version on https://www.sqlite.org/index.html
    - Currently there are no JavaFX specific changes made in SQLite source.
      In case you find any changes make sure to retain them with update.

3. Get the source code of required release version of SQLite.
    - Download the amalgamation code for the release from https://www.sqlite.org
       - For example, the SQLite 3.37.2 amalgamation is named as "sqlite-amalgamation-3370200.zip".
    - FYI about amalgamation:
      - The amalgamation contains everything a library may need to include SQLite.
      - Over 100 separate source files are concatenated into a single large C file
        named "sqlite3.c" and referred as "the amalgamation".

4. Update the SQLite source files in JavaFX from the downloaded amalgamation source.
    - Retain JavaFX changes, if any.

5. Update the new version in VERSION.txt.

6. Perform build and sanity testing.

7. Helper commands for removing tabs and trailing whitespaces from source files(.h and .c).
   7.1 > cd modules/javafx.web/src/main/native/Source/ThirdParty/sqlite
   7.2 Remove tabs from source files:
     > sudo apt install moreutils
     > find . -name "*.c" -type f -exec bash -c 'expand -t 4 "$0" | sponge "$0"' {} \;
     > find . -name "*.h" -type f -exec bash -c 'expand -t 4 "$0" | sponge "$0"' {} \;
   7.3 Remove trailing whitespaces from source files:
     > find . -name “*.c” -type f -exec sed --in-place 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' {} \+
     > find . -name “*.h” -type f -exec sed --in-place 's/[[:space:]]\+$//' {} \+
